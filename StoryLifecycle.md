# Story lifecycle

**Stories** Stories and issues are created to capture work that needs to be done by the team. They are small enough to be completed within a single sprint; if a story needs multiple sprints to finish, then it should be re-written into multiple smaller stories that can be worked on incrementally.
Our team utilizes five active swimlanes to manage our work.*


## New issues/upcoming

- Stories that are prioritized for the next one to three sprints
- **Entrance**: When new stories or issues emerge, they are added to this swimlane and the “unprioritized” label is added so the team can review during stand-up
- Backlog grooming reviews and determines the estimates for the stories that have been prioritized for the upcoming sprint
- **Exit**: Prioritized and estimated stories for the next sprint are moved into the sprint backlog during sprint planning


## Sprint backlog

- Prioritized and groomed stories/issues that have been selected for the current sprint.
- **Entrance**: Stories/issues are pulled from the new issues/upcoming swimlane into the sprint backlog during sprint planning.
- **Exit**: During the sprint, the team pulls the next thing to work on from the top of the sprint backlog and into the doing swimlane.


## Doing

- Stories/issues that are in progress/being worked on in the current sprint.
- **Entrance**: Team members pull a story into the doing column from the sprint backlog when they begin work on a given story/issue.
- **Exit**: Stories/issues are moved to the closed swimlane once they are complete.


## Blocked

- Work that is blocked by internal or external entities.
- **Entrance**: Stories or issues are moved to blocked if the team is being prevented from completing the work.
- **Exit**: Stories or issues are moved out of blocked once the blocker has been resolved.

## Closed

**Entrance**: Team members move stories/issues to the close swimlane once the work is complete (satisfy the acceptance criteria) OR stories/issues are no longer relevant or a priority.

## Icebox*

- **Entrance**: Stories/issues move into the icebox during review of “unprioritized” stories, during backlog grooming, or when the team determines a story is more than three sprints out, making it a lower priority. 
- A “stale” tag is automatically applied to stories that have been inactive for 60 days - the team will review stale stories at the end of stand-up and during designated time during backlog grooming.
- **Exit**: Stories can move out of the icebox several ways. 
1. Stories/issues that have been inactive for 120 days will be automatically closed. 
2. Stories/issues can move out of the icebox during review of  “stale” stories  during backlog grooming or stand-up. These stories could move to closed if they are no longer relevant/a priority or to new issues/upcoming, sprint backlog, or doing if they have become a priority. 
- Less actively used than the other five swimlanes
