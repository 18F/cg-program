# Story lifecycle

**Stories** Stories and issues are created to capture work that needs to be done by the team. Our goal is to create multiple smaller stories that can be worked on incrementally rather than one large story that takes significant time to complete.
Our team utilizes four swimlanes to manage our work.


## Backlog

- Prioritized and groomed stories/issues. 
- **Entrance**: Weekly prioritization meeting reviews and prioritizes stories to develop a list in rank order of the 10 highest priorities stories/issues.
- **Exit**: The team pulls the next thing to work on from the top of the backlog and into the doing swimlane.


## Doing

- Stories/issues that are in progress/actively being worked on.
- **Entrance**: Team members pull a story into the doing column from the backlog when they begin work on a given story/issue.
- **Exit**: Stories/issues are moved to the closed swimlane once they are complete.


## Blocked

- Work that is blocked by internal or external entities.
- **Entrance**: Stories or issues are moved to blocked if the team is being prevented from completing the work.
- **Exit**: Stories or issues are moved out of blocked once the blocker has been resolved.

## Closed

**Entrance**: Team members move stories/issues to the close swimlane once the work is complete (satisfy the acceptance criteria) OR stories/issues are no longer relevant or a priority.
