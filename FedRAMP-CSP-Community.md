# FedRAMP CSP Community

Welcome to the FedRAMP CSP community listserv!

Purpose: Provide a forum for compliance staff at cloud service
providers (CSPs) that are FedRAMP-authorized, or pursuing FedRAMP
authorization.

The compliance team at cloud.gov (FedRAMP JAB authorized) started
this community as we felt really isolated in our work on POA&Ms,
Annual Assessments, SCRs, and addressing OMB mandates.

We've started this community to help solve these common problems
in way that's unrelated to any "competitive advantage." If we can 
make any process easier for many CSPs, that's win for everyone - 
and especially for the U.S. Government that's consuming these services.

# FedRAMP Compliance Practitioner listserv charter

Membership: Open to compliance staff at CSPs listed at
https://marketplace.fedramp.gov as authorized or in-process. If the
CSP has retained a 3PAO to pursue authorization, they are also
eligible for participation. 

The TTS cloud.gov compliance team will
approve memberships.

This will be a closed list. Membership and discussions will not be
published nor searchable, but will be subject to FOIA. Discussions
are not deemed policy making or advising, as the FedRAMP PMO is not
participating in the listserv.

The TTS code of conduct will apply.

Notes:

- The listserv is not directly affiliated with FedRAMP. Both FedRAMP
  and cloud.gov are programs of TTS Solutions, within GSA.
