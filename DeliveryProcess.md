# Delivery process

The cloud.gov team applies a subset of [the Scaled Agile Framework](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) (SAFe) to guide its program structure, as described in [Essential SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/guidance-essential-safe/). We set goals and prioritize work in three month periods called "program increments," or PIs, and practice a number of SAFe rituals around this quarterly cadence.

To manage our day-to-day work, we practice Scrumban, which means we practice [Kanban](http://blog.crisp.se/2009/06/26/henrikkniberg/1246053060000) around cardwall-style boards that track work from left-to-right as it is identified, prioritized, explored, delivered, and demonstrated. We augment Kanban with a subset of Scrum activities: 

- a rapid (15-minute vidconf) or asynchronous (in Slack) daily standup per squad to communicate about the status of work on the board
- bi-weekly sprint demos for stakeholders and colleagues of each squad's recent work
- bi-weekly retrospectives for each squad
- occasional higher-level planning and grooming sessions
 
## Squads
