AC-8,Moderate,"FedRAMP has established, per https://github.com/GSA/threat-analysis that AC-8 has minimal protection value (0.25 PV). The ""Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance"" should be removed entirely."
AU-6,Moderate,"In ""Moderate Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance"", the word ""multi-tennant"" is misspelled."
CP-2,All,"CP-3 (a) (1) should change from 10 days to 30 days or even 60 days. We have found system engineers don't have enough context just 10 days into the position for the CP training to have significant value. Training in contingency plan response takes more situational awareness for full impact. Extending the time period to 60 days will allow for more cohort training, which also results in better training outcomes."
IR-2,All,"IR-2 (a) (1) should change from 10 days to 30 days or even 60 days. We have found system engineers don't have enough context just 10 days into the position for the IR training to have significant value. While engineers should certainly be trained in incident _reporting_ during their first 10 days, training in incident response takes more situational awareness for full impact. Extending the time period to 60 days will allow for more cohort training, which also results in better training outcomes."
SA-10,Moderate,"SA-10 (e) Requirement: -- update to include _how_ flaws should be reported. One presumes through the POA&M and ConMon process, but it's not clear."
SC-13,All,"SC-13 language needs to address the case when there's a conflict between SC-13 and RA-5/SI-02. CSPs cannot be in a position of running known vulnerable versions of cryptographic software. When there's a patch available to a FIPS-validated component, the CSP should be able to patch that component pending the re-validation through the CMVP. The language of SC-13 should reflect the obvious choice of real operational security over theoretical CMVP protection. 
FedRAMP's own research at https://github.com/GSA/threat-analysis shows that the protection values of RA-5 (61.82) and SI-2 (45.59) far exceed the protection value of SC-13 (4.6), and CSPs should be able to respond to a changing threat landscape accordingly. "
SC-13,All,"SC-13 should allow the use of non-validated cryptography when the CSP can show that the proposed algorithm provides a significantly superior solution to what FIPS offers. NIST itself recommends non-validated cryptographic functions, e.g, in https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html  (BALLOON, etc.). SC-13 should not require vendors to provide in plain-text (and hence not subject to SC13) data or communications that are better protected by non-validated cryptography (ref: https://hackernoon.com/the-trouble-with-fips)"
SC-20,All,"The SC-20 guidance should explicitly exclude internal DNS where DNS is used for internal service discovery and there are compensating mechanisms for host validation. That is, customers on cloud.gov can use the `app.internal` domain for lightweight service discovery in microservice architectures. When mutual TLS is used there's minimal risk of host impersonation, and deploying DNSSEC in this case is impractical. There are similar host discovery mechanisms for Kubernetes and CloudFoundry that use in-cluster DNS. In these situations  DNSSEC makes so sense, and TLS provides a strong host authenticity mechanism, and should be accommodated."
SC-20,All,"Since it's well known that DNSSEC provides little protection to public end-users, CSPs providing services over HTTPS should be be able to use HSTS with domain pre-loading and certificate transparency log monitoring to provide stronger security guarantees than DNSSEC is able to provide. This use case may only apply to domains where HTTPS is only service generally provided (e.g. mail providers would need DNSSEC or another means for validating host authenticity)"
SC-28,Moderate,"""with"" is misspelled as ""whith"""
SC-28,Moderate,"Scenario B is unclear. It makes a comparison but there's only one option listed.  That is, it currently reads:

> For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.

but it's not clear what ""encryption at the file system level"" is being compared to."
SC-5,Moderate,"The ""Moderate FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters
(Numbering matches SSP)"" should be updated to read, ""known buffer overflow attacks"" (emphasis added) since we can't proactively protect against unknown buffer overflows "
SC-7,,SC-7 guidance regarding VLANs is seems to only apply to CSPs building on physical infrastructure. The guidance may need to clarify the requirements for CSPs leveraging authorized IaaSes or PaaSes
SR-01,All,"SR-1 (c) (1) [at least annually]  should change to every 3 years, consistent with other policy update parameters. Organizations like GSA already have mature SCRM policies which will not necessarily need annual updates to be relevant."
