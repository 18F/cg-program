Getting Paid
============

cloud.gov gives vendors the flexibility to choose the payment processor that works best for them. All we need is a place to enter our credit card information. This is known as a vendor's **Payment URL.**

To specify or update your Payment URL, simply provide it in a post on the issue after you are declared the winner. We'll issue payment at your Payment URL when you win an auction and meet its acceptance criteria before the delivery deadline. Please note that if you use a payment processor that charges us a fee, that fee will be deducted from the award.

PS: One payment processor we've seen used is [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/tutorial). Stripe is simple to setup, and doesn't charge a fee for those issuing payment. What's more, one vendor actually wrote an open source app to [deploy a Stripe payment form via Heroku](https://github.com/cwarden/pay).
