# Onboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone new joins the cloud.gov team:

1. The cloud.gov director or deputy director adds the new team member to the `cloud-gov` team in GitHub. This constitutes 'formal approval` by leadership and enables access to to the [cg-private GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/private) for the next step
1. Create a new card in the [cg-private Github repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/private/issues) called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
  * Use of a private repo helps satisfy AC-2, that we have officially added a person to our team before further onboarding.
2. View the raw source of this file.
3. Copy the text before the checklists to the Description field of the card.
3. Copy each applicable block of tasks into a its own new task list on the card, replacing "NewPerson" with the new person's name and  "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
4. Submit the card.
5. Assign the person who bravely volunteered to be the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the card.
6. Put the issue into the _Doing_ column.

---

In order to get NewPerson productively contributing to the cloud.gov team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you can’t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

### Getting to know cloud.gov

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or cloud.gov is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template Onboarding checklist](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md).
- [ ] Figure out who your onboarding buddy is (they should reach out to you) and make sure this issue is assigned to them in our [Github Project Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/projects/2).We use this board to organize, prioritize, and track our work.
- [ ] Read [the team onboarding document](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/Onboarding.md) for more context about cloud.gov.
- [ ] Bookmark the [pertinent links listed here](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/PertinentLinks.md).
- [ ] Read through [the Overview section of our site](https://cloud.gov/docs/overview/what-is-cloudgov/) for a broader understanding of cloud.gov, especially how we present it to potential customers and users.
- [ ] [Sign up for a cloud.gov sandbox](https://cloud.gov/sign-up/#get-trial-access-and-a-free-sandbox-space) and start experimenting to get familiar with the basics of the PaaS from a user's perspective.
- [ ] Read the [Delivery Process document](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/StoryLifecycle.md) to learn about how we work.
- [ ] Read our [service disruption guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/service-disruption-guide/) to learn how we handle customer-facing service disruptions.
- [ ] Add the [cloud.gov Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx6EvBXVDWwheUtVckVnOE1pRzA) to your Google Drive -- that's where we put cloud.gov docs. If you create or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Subscribe to [the cloud.gov team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_0samf7guodi7o2jhdp0ec99aks@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles) (click the + in the bottom right) so you know when assorted team meetings are happening in the various squads. Tip: When you plan Out of Office time, make a calendar event for that on the cloud.gov calendar so that your teammates know you'll be away

### Required items for all team members

These items help us fulfill security and compliance requirements (including for FedRAMP). If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from your buddy or in a cloud.gov channel.

#### Pre-requisites

- [ ] Complete [GSA OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) GSA Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training, including accepting the GSA IT Rules of Behavior, which is required before we can give you access to any cloud.gov systems.

### Install a development environment for cloud.gov

- [ ] Install [Homebrew (`brew`)](https://brew.sh/)

  - `brew install openssl`
- [ ] Verify CloudFoundry Installation via the CLI (once an existing cloud.gov teammate has [made your cloud.gov admin account](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/managing-users/#creating-admins))
  - `cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso`
  - `cf orgs`
    - As a cloud.gov team member, you should have a very giant list of organizations
    - If you have none or one (e.g. sandbox) org, contact your facilitator

- [ ] Install the Concourse `fly` CLI
  - Download the `fly` binary zip for MacOS from https://concourse-ci.org/

- [ ] Install cloud.gov dev tools by cloning the [`cg-scripts` repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-scripts/)
  - `git clone https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-scripts.git`

### Figure out your first tasks

Work with your onboarding buddy to determine a platform component to work on first.
Once you've identified the component you're going to focus on, your onboarding buddy will introduce
you to someone who can onboard you to that project in specific. For the next few sprints, work on features,
bugs, and improvements on this component. Reach out to your onboarding buddy or anyone else on the team 
if you need any help. Here are some easily-separated pieces to consider:

- S3 broker (Golang, Open Service Broker API)
- Aws broker (Golang, Open Service Broker API)
- Domain brokers and friends (New stuff is all python + Open Service Broker API):
  - External-domain broker 
  - legacy domain broker
  - cdn broker
- Logging stack (BOSH, ELK)
- Prometheus (BOSH)
- Stratos (golang + js)
- uaa-extras (python + OIDC)
- shibboleth (Java, OIDC)
