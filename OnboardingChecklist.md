# Onboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone new joins the cloud.gov team:

1. The cloud.gov director or deputy director adds the new team member to the `cloud-gov` team in GitHub. This constitutes 'formal approval` by leadership and enables access to to the [cg-private GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/private) for the next step
1. Create a new card in the [cg-private Github repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/private/issues) called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
  * Use of a private repo helps satisfy AC-2, that we have officially added a person to our team before further onboarding.
2. View the raw source of this file.
3. Copy the text before the checklists to the Description field of the card.
3. Copy each applicable block of tasks into a its own new task list on the card, replacing "NewPerson" with the new person's name and  "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
4. Submit the card.
5. Assign the person who bravely volunteered to be the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the card.
6. Put the issue into the _Doing_ column.

---

In order to get NewPerson productively contributing to the cloud.gov team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you can’t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

### Getting to know cloud.gov

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or cloud.gov is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template Onboarding checklist](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md).
- [ ] Figure out who your onboarding buddy is (they should reach out to you) and make sure this issue is assigned to them in our [Github Project Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/projects/2).We use this board to organize, prioritize, and track our work.
- [ ] Read [the team onboarding document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/Onboarding.md) for more context about cloud.gov.
- [ ] Bookmark the [pertinent links listed here](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/PertinentLinks.md).
- [ ] Read the ["cloud.gov: What is it?"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nCcti3dXG9TVGW3OqaWtnf96oXX8U8SBTM_WePFO_dg/edit#slide=id.p) presentation for a rundown of what cloud.gov is and does (specifically read slides 1-37; the rest are somewhat outdated)
- [ ] Read through [the Overview section of our site](https://cloud.gov/docs/overview/what-is-cloudgov/) for a broader understanding of cloud.gov, especially how we present it to potential customers and users.
- [ ] Read the [January 2016 cloud.gov "Executive Business Case" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/138OcG0Lt6gr9J0wM0TzzPNyTROmYAwfLIDujtweiwGw/edit#) for greater context about cloud.gov's potential impact in government.
- [ ] Read the [House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (July 12 2017) document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDJdaPw7DSBPSa-XH-YsQpJVOmRKSK8sAghNhPFpegE/edit) for official answers to important questions such as "Why would agencies use cloud.gov instead of building their own?"
- [ ] [Sign up for a cloud.gov sandbox](https://cloud.gov/sign-up/#get-trial-access-and-a-free-sandbox-space) and start experimenting to get familiar with the basics of the PaaS from a user's perspective.
- [ ] Read the [Delivery Process document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/DeliveryProcess.md) to learn about how we work.
- [ ] Read our [service disruption guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/service-disruption-guide/) to learn how we handle customer-facing service disruptions.
- [ ] Join [the cloud.gov team Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?hl=en#!forum/cloud-gov) so you can participate in team-wide internal communication.
- [ ] Business Unit Only - Join the [cloud.gov inquiries Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/cloud-gov-inquiries) so you can keep apprised of prospective new clients.
- [ ] Add the [cloud.gov Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx6EvBXVDWwheUtVckVnOE1pRzA) to your Google Drive -- that's where we put cloud.gov docs. If you create or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Subscribe to [the cloud.gov team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_0samf7guodi7o2jhdp0ec99aks@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles) (click the + in the bottom right) so you know when assorted team meetings are happening in the various squads. Tip: When you plan Out of Office time, make a calendar event for that on the cloud.gov calendar so that your teammates know you'll be away
- [ ] Once you've finished the checklists below, make suggestions for steps that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on [the onboarding checklist template](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md) used to make this issue.

### Required items for all team members
