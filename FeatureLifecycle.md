**Features** are user-notable, program-sequenced, roadmap-worthy changes in product capabilities tracked against cadence-driven periodic milestones... big stuff that's worth planning and announcing on a regular basis. Features are fairly general, encompassing a set of stories which break down the actual changes in product behavior that we're after to get the intended benefits of the feature. Generally we do coarse analysis and UX exploration work at the Feature level.
 
Features are generally tracked by their status and against the quarterly cadence on [the Program collection](https://favro.com/organization/1e11108a2da81e3bd7153a7a/0b64f44bc57f65052fad8244).

Features progress through these columns in the Feature Kanban on the [the Program collection](https://favro.com/organization/1e11108a2da81e3bd7153a7a/0b64f44bc57f65052fad8244):

- Funnel (to note that we have heard about the need but otherwise not advanced it)
- Analysis (where we explore our options for overall UX and implementation, and set objective metrics and outcomes)
- Backlog (when the feature is basically well-understood at a high level and awaits squad-level attention)
- Implementing (while implementation is in progress)
- Verifying (while they are being evaluated as delivering their intended benefit, open to customer feedback)
- Done (when they are confirmed as meeting their target, and no longer a focus)

Features are also tracked against the Program Increment (PI) where we suspect they'll be delivered based on our best understanding of our current priorities and progress.

- Backlog: Describe what we're after, what benefits it's expected to deliver, and any relevant design/research artifacts. That's it! Any more detail than that should appear in stories.
