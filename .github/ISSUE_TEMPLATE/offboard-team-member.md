# Team Member Offboarding Checklist

## When do we offboard a team member?

We must offboard a team member when they are:

- Absent for 30 or more days, or about to be. For example, team members on detail or extended leave.
- Permanently separating from the team. For example, terminated or reassigned.

See our [AC Policy](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-compliance-docs/blob/main/AC-Policy.md), "When a privileged team member has been absent...".

## Special Notes

- **Do not create this issue until the System Owner has formally authorized and requested it.** You can obtain that OK by one of two ways:
  A:

  - [ ] A: System Owner creates this issue

  B:

  - [ ] B.1: System owner emails cloud-gov-compliance@gsa.gov and cloud-gov-operations@gsa.gov with their authorization
  - [ ] B.2: An operator adds links to the email archive of the authorizing email.

- **Please only use first names.**

## Instructions

- [ ] Assign this ticket to the person currently staffing the maintenance rotation.

In order to complete `Existing Person`'s exit from the cloud.gov team, the assignee should complete a prescribed set of tasks that will remove any special access.

**Assignee:** The tasks below are organized by the role needed to complete them. If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate person does it_.

For compliance we need to show that critical offboarding actions happen within 24 hours of departure; some actions below **need GitHub issues comments** when completed. Completing tasks _before_ departure is good. (control PS-4: personnel termination).

## `Existing Person`

- [ ] Initiate the process via the [Leaving TTS Handbook page](https://handbook.18f.gov/leaving-tts/)

## Assignee

If the person offboarding is a contractor, reach out to the COR to ensure any offboarding steps specific to their contract are being completed.

  - Check one of the following:
    - [ ] Temporary federal departure: Remove them all private cloud.gov Slack channels, except `#cg-priv-gov`, so they may continue to receive essential team communications.
    - [ ] Permanent departure: If the person is leaving permanently, they will be removed from all channels automatically.

  - Invites where they are listed as part of the `cloud.gov` invitee group will be removed when they are removed from that group by the System Owner
