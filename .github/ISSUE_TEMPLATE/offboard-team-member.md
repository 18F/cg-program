# Platform Operator Offboarding Checklist

## Special Notes

- **Do not create this issue until the System Owner has formally authorized and requested it.** You can obtain that OK by one of two ways:
  A:
  - [ ] A: System Owner creates this issue

  B:
  - [ ] B.1: System owner emails cloud-gov-compliance@gsa.gov and cloud-gov-operations@gsa.gov with their authorization
  - [ ] B.2: An operator adds links to the email archive of the authorizing email.
- **Please only use first names.**

## Instructions

In order to complete `Existing Person`'s exit from the cloud.gov team, the assignee should complete a prescribed set of tasks that will remove any special access.

**Assignee:** The tasks below are organized by the role needed to complete them. If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate person does it_.

For compliance we need to show that critical offboarding actions happen within 24 hours of departure; some actions below **need GitHub issues comments** when completed. Completing tasks _before_ departure is good. (control PS-4: personnel termination).

## `Existing Person`

- [ ] Initiate the process via the [Leaving TTS Handbook page](https://handbook.18f.gov/leaving-tts/)

If the person offboarding is a contractor follow the steps in the [offboarding checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u5GQ2i4u20x3r1ryXifWf99ZM_U6BPOu-rHaoFADZ6k/edit#gid=1078790596)t in addition to the following steps below.
