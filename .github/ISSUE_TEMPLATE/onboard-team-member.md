In order to get `New Person` productively contributing to the cloud.gov team, `Buddy` should help `New Person` complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed and get them setup with cloud.gov.

## Instructions

1. Try to go through the checklists in order.
2. If `Buddy` can’t complete any of the items on their checklist personally, _they are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## Onboarding Checklist

### Required items for all team members

These items help us fulfill security and compliance requirements (including for FedRAMP). If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from your buddy or in a cloud.gov channel.

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or cloud.gov is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your onboarding buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template Onboarding checklist](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/general-team-member-onboarding.md).
- [ ] Be sure to introduce yourself and follow up with your onboarding buddy (they should have reached out to you at this point; if they haven't, please let the team know) and make sure this issue is assigned to them in our [Github Project Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/projects/2). We use this board to organize, prioritize, and track our work.

#### Pre-requisites

- [ ] Complete [GSA OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) GSA Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training, including accepting the GSA IT Rules of Behavior, which is required before we can give you access to any cloud.gov systems. If you joined GSA more than two months ago, you've already completed this task and can just check the box.

#### Fulfill security and compliance requirements (including for FedRAMP) - Completed by onboarding buddy

- [ ] Make sure they're in [the list of people working on the project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/187663k5MYJBNlKExLu_nhuovcZQfIbqYCu2n4noNY1o/edit#gid=0).
- [ ] Add their name, whether they're Cloud Ops (Platform), and the date they joined the team to the [training tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqU6cNeEB293OT0j3OvbdAFRkrf2zDOrPVxGfnr4sSw/edit#gid=0). Copy the formulas for the due dates from an existing row (grab the "corner" of the cells and pull down).
- [ ] As they complete training, fill out their completion dates in the [training tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqU6cNeEB293OT0j3OvbdAFRkrf2zDOrPVxGfnr4sSw/edit#gid=0).
- [ ] Add them to the @cloud-gov-team [in Slack’s Team Directory](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-User-Groups#edit-a-user-group).
- [ ] Review the recurring cloud.gov meetings that are relevant for them in [the team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_0samf7guodi7o2jhdp0ec99aks@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles) (they will get access to this when added to the cloud.gov Team Google Group).
- [ ] Add them to the [`cloud-gov`](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/people) organization in GitHub, and the [`cloud-gov-team`](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/teams/cloud-gov-team) team.

#### Learn our policies and procedures

For the three trainings list at the top, your onboarding buddy will create a separate ticket to track the trainings once scheduling has been finished.  This will help consolidate trainings for multiple new members to the team and prevent them from blocking progress on this onboarding ticket.  Once the trainings are scheduled, they can be marked as complete here.

* [ ] Coordinate with your onboarding buddy to go through [Incident Response Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AZjQE8zBzMRWZIFUuJPkJLted1ykGtALrLPoPRx5Vls/edit#slide=id.p) within 60 days of joining the team (and annually after that). This will cover the following document, which you should also review before or after training:
  * [ ] Read the [Incident Response Guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/security-ir/).
* [ ] Coordinate with your onboarding buddy to go through [nonpublic information training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uB4MlGCu8ZYUxjKVZKwicQ95MvLxaT4Mh93y6w79GPw/edit#slide=id.p) within 60 days of joining the team (and annually after that). This will cover the following documents, which you should also review before or after training:
  * [ ] Review the [TTS requirements for password management](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/tech-policies/password-requirements/).
* [ ] Read the [cloud.gov Security Policies and Procedures](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-compliance-docs). These documents explain the high-level policies and procedures we must comply with while running cloud.gov, sorted into security control "families" They explain that we follow GSA IT security policy, and they provide a summary of the procedures in our System Security Plan.

### Getting to know cloud.gov

These items will help you come up to speed on cloud.gov and what it is, how it works, why it exists, etc.  While you
should take the time to go through them, please do not try and tackle it all in one shot!  It can become overwhelming
very quickly, so your onboarding buddy will walk through this list with you at a high level with you to help manage the work.

- [ ] Read [the team onboarding document](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/Onboarding.md) for more context about cloud.gov.
- [ ] Bookmark the [pertinent links listed here](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/PertinentLinks.md).
- [ ] Read through [the Overview section of our site](https://cloud.gov/docs/overview/what-is-cloudgov/) for a broader understanding of cloud.gov, especially how we present it to potential customers and users.
- [ ] [Sign up for a cloud.gov sandbox](https://cloud.gov/sign-up/#get-trial-access-and-a-free-sandbox-space) using your GSA email address and start experimenting to get familiar with the basics of the PaaS from a user's perspective.
- [ ] Read the [Delivery Process document](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/master/StoryLifecycle.md) to learn about how we work.
- [ ] Add the [cloud.gov Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx6EvBXVDWwheUtVckVnOE1pRzA) to your Google Drive -- that's where we put cloud.gov docs. If you create or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Subscribe to [the cloud.gov team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_0samf7guodi7o2jhdp0ec99aks@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles) (click the + in the bottom right) so you know when assorted team meetings are happening in the various squads. Tip: When you plan Out of Office time, make a calendar event for that on the cloud.gov calendar so that your teammates know you'll be away

### Slack channels

Your onboarding buddy will add you to these Slack channels:

- [ ] `#cloud-gov` - bots post announcements here
- [ ] `#cg-billing` - private business development channel (if applicable)
- [ ] `#cg-business` - business development (if applicable)
- [ ] `#cg-offtopic` - off-topic team sharing
- [ ] `#cg-general` - program-level information and discusion
- [ ] `#cg-priv-all` - private channel for in-team discussion
- [ ] `#cg-priv-gov` (Federal employees only) - may contain discussion of contracting-related or other private, federal-employee-only comms

Business team members should be added to:

- [ ] `#cg-oa` - Office of Acquisition, a federal-only channel with contracting officers

Once you're added to these channels, you probably want to mute these channels until you're on support rotation:

- [ ] `#cg-support` - support requests and assistance within TTS
- [ ] `#cg-platform-news` - platform alerts
