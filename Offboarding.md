# Leaving the cloud.gov team

## Instructions

When someone leaves the cloud.gov team:


1. The System Owner (Director or Deputy Director) creates a new issue in the [cg-product Github repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/issues) called "Authorize Offboarding for [ExistingPerson]".  This constitutes 'formal approval' by leadership.
  - The System Owner must do this step. An assignee can add the checklist afterward if the System Owner hasn't already.
  - Use of an issue that only the System Owner is authorized to create before offboarding can proceed helps us satisfy the AC-2 control.
2. The System Owner or an assignee who bravely volunteered to handle the person's offboarding creates a new issue in the [cg-product Github repo](https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/issues) called `System Owner Authorization for Offboarding an Existing Team Member`.
5. Put the offboarding checklist issue into the _Doing_ column in our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-gov/projects/2).
